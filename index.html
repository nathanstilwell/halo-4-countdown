            <p>Decades from now, when historians evaluate the war, what will they say about us? Will they claim that our victory was ultimately fruitless? That it failed to secure a lasting peace, or worse, that it was only a prelude to far greater horrors that now lay ahead?</p>

            <p>My hope – OUR HOPE – is that history would instead view this war as a catalyst. That the last thirty years were a crucible, a threshing floor for our species, sifting out our fears and frailties. And that ultimately it made us stronger and more vigilant in the end, fully prepared for whatever will come next. After all, what good is struggle if there is no change? What good is a fire if the sword is not made stronger?</p>

            <p>Attached are four reports accounting the major contingency structures our species currently faces in the wake of the war. Please evaluate them closely. Their outcomes will dictate how history views us, or if history even views us at all.</p>

            Provenancial element [4/5]<br>

            </p>

            <p>As Machiavelli once said: “the Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only put off to the advantage of others.”</p>

            <p>Likewise, we must deal with these issues head-on, without fear and without hesitation. We can afford no other stance.</p>

          <p>SPECIES CANDIDATE//LINE RECORD 94:73:02:75</p>
          <p>UNGGOY// Sensors at Balaho indicate stability, no off-planet transport recorded since Solipsis. Runners are claiming that Buwan has been abandoned as well, but we’re keeping our eyes on it anyway. Moderate Unggoy populations have been observed in Sangheilian systems at various intervals.</p>
          <p>KIG-YAR// Eayn’s native population continues to grow and expand within reasonable governing parameters; its economic and social lines have stabilized in the wake of the war. Muloqt, Kaelarot, and Valyanop, the primary interplanetary colonial sites, all remain static, with little notable movement. There are rumors of mercenaries operating alongside a handful of more conservative Sangheili states, although that has yet to be substantiated.</p>
          <p>SANGHEILI// Most intel here originates from ground contacts, but sensors have assisted with validation. The primary issue with the Sangheili is that of discordant cultural symmetry. It is difficult to assess military growth across several dozen active colonial vectors all with disparate political structures. Nevertheless, any and all visible military activity appears to be internecine in nature.</p>
          <p>NOTE: A cluster of Sangheili frontier worlds saw a sudden and anomalous convergence of unregistered ships, largely cruisers of varying classes according to a handful of remote relays stationed nearby. By the time sensors were deployed, the ships were gone. The relays can’t assess numbers or strength, but the readings we have indicate that this wasn’t an expeditionary voyage or something tied to a single state. It appears to have been much larger.</p>

          /START FILE/</p>

          <p>Realistically, the pervasiveness of the modern soldier will never
          be on the decline, at least not in our time. But ubiquity and
          numbers don’t always guarantee operational success, something
          Naval Intelligence recognized long ago. Rather than drown out our
          enemies in an avalanche of bodies, we saw the value intrinsic in
          the specialization and refinement of a very select number of
          soldiers - a remarkably select number, actually.</p>

          <p>This is how the Spartan branch came to be.</p>

          <p>By reverting back to ORION protocols, the sins of the previous
          administrations have been averted this time around. Unlike
          SPARTAN-II and SPARTAN-III, which will likely face severe ethical
          scrutiny in the years to come, the SPARTAN-IV project was
          centered on properly screened recruits, both career military
          veterans and young soldiers who showed significant promise. After
          passing a rigorous series of tests, admission to the program was
          a matter of discretion, not compulsion.</p>

          <p>From a psychological perspective, the coalescent solidarity of
          these men and women has been nothing short of astonishing,
          particularly over a relatively short period of time. Many have
          even adopted some of the colloquial pejoratives used by S-II
          operatives years ago [i.e. ‘alpha bravo’ (‘alien bastard’)].
          Behavioral shifts like these have and will continue to
          differentiate S-IVs from the others who serve alongside them. It
          clearly suggests that the Spartan branch has rapidly and
          unapologetically become its own thing... almost overnight.</p>

          <p>But what value is a warrior without a war? What good is weapon
          without a threat to give it purpose? You know as well as I that
          these are the very questions that were asked just before the
          beginning of the last civil conflict we faced and these are the
          same questions that are being asked now - asked by those who feel
          they have the most to lose.</p>

          <p>We dispatched an isolation contact group [L3-08] to the site.
          Upon entering the debris field, the group was immediately pinged
          by a non-standard, heterogenic signal emanating from the
          structure’s surface – or, at least, what remained of it after the
          event.</p>

          <p>Following protocol, the contact group released probes [839] into
          the debris field. Once it was deemed secure by composite scans
          conducted over the course of 3.7 days, UNSC RUBICON was deployed
          from Luna. Aboard were a number of high-risk, remote contact
          teams [RCT] outfitted for deployment to the construct’s surface.</p>

          <p>Without the installation’s artificial sun operating at full
          capacity, navigating the debris field for insertion was difficult
          – navigating the installation’s surface itself was even more
          difficult. The damage was... traumatic.</p>

          <p>Habitability sustainment systems were still active in some
          locations, but were operating intermittently and in a state of
          disrepair – a factor that generated extremely volatile weather
          conditions. Some indigenous [if it can be called that] fauna may
          have survived the event, but RCTs were strictly advised to avoid
          all potentially hostile life forms.</p>

          <p>After 8.4 days, all contact with RCTs was severed. Only one [RCT-
          06] returned, suffering extensive casualties. They brought back a
          severely damaged armature, which appeared to be the original
          source of the signal. Initially, there was a strong suspicion of
          this armature’s origin, but local science teams undertook an
          aggressive node cultivation process to withdraw data from the
          device and determine, with veracity, its actual origin.</p>

          <p>All communications with the UNSC RUBICON halted within 48 hours
          of their last notice. Search and rescue teams have been deployed
          to the site, but have reported no findings yet.</p>
