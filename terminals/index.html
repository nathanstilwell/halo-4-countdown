Observed extensive ground action on
[LP 656-38 e]. 9,045 survivors
barricaded within central government
building. Structure's defenses
inadequate to withstand extended
siege by enemy ground forces
(" 1,572,034,315+). Estimate
position overrun in [173 hours].

846 smaller groups in less
defensible structures: global
distribution corresponding to
[probability model zeta].
Estimated local position overrun
in [9 hours] (average).


---[1-2]---------------------------------
Observed local naval forces engage
enemy irregular naval group near
[DM -3-1123]. Enemy group consisted
of 149 commercial shipping vessels,
passenger ferries, and private
recreational vessels from
neighboring system. Enemy losses
were total. No damage was sustained
by local naval vessels.

However, it was immediately apparent
that enemy group sought only to
enter [DM-3-1123 b's] atmosphere and
make landfall. In this they were
partially successful.


---[1-3]---------------------------------
Observed extensive ground action on
[DM-3-1123 b]. Enemy forces lacked
basic unit cohesion but quickly
gained numerical superiority.
[32 hours] after enemy landfall 83%
of local naval forces advocated total
[destruction of the biosphere]
following the evacuation of
unmolested population centers.
Enemy losses were total.

Estimated number of citizens
evacuated before commencement of
orbital blanket bombardment:
1,318,797 civilian/42,669 military
(.0006% of total population).

 // FRAGMENT 1/7 [RECORDED VERBATIM
AND INTERPRETED POST-CATACLYSM]

L: Categorization has sped since the
improvements were announced, but
there are many hurdles. The indexing
of sentient species may have
irreversible effects on the
surviving insentient species.
We will have extinction events and
irreparable environmental harm on at
least 18 worlds. Current projections
estimate post-archival cataclysm on
as many as 31 worlds. The paucity of
sentience has been a blessing in
this regard.


---[1-N-2]---------------------------------
D: How formal you are, Librarian.
We're receiving shipments of indexed
beings more frequently than
communications. Don't compound
scarcity with brevity.

I know things beyond the [Maginot]
line are harried. But I worry about
you. I've asked you time and time
again. Abandon your cataloguing.
Come back inside, where my fleets
can keep you safe.

Come home.


---[1-N-3]---------------------------------
L: Would that it were my choice.
I have committed to this course
because it's the right thing to do.
We no longer have the manpower or
materiel to excise remedial measures
at a planetary level. I certainly
can't justify using the [transit
measure] to save my own skin when
there are still so many innocents to
protect and index.


---[1-N-4]---------------------------------
D: You know I oppose your mission,
but you're exceeding its parameters
anyway. You've put yourself in
jeopardy. You've done enough.

If you will not come to me, I will
find my way to you.


---[1-N-5]---------------------------------
L: We have no time to spare, Didact.
Every vessel we can fill, we send to
the Ark. I dare not cease the
mission. Not now, not until I've
done all I can. Each one of these
souls is finite and precious.

And I'm close.

Close to saving them all.

//FRAGMENT ENDS

---[1-L-1]---------------------------------
[29,478 hours] have passed since I
left the [Maginot] sphere and
entered contested space.

The enemy is everywhere.

Despite this the morale of my
charges remains high. They wake,
clean themselves, fuel their bodies,
communicate with one another,
eliminate waste, train to destroy
the enemy, and return to sleep. The
sacrifices they have chosen to make
on behalf of their [brethren]
fills me with pride.


---[1-L-2]---------------------------------
If only I could save them all - but
they know, perhaps even better than
I, that that is not possible.

[37 seconds] ago I moved beyond my
ability to observe the events taking
place on [CE-10-2165-d].

The importance of my mission forbade
me from rendering any aid, but no
less important was the need for me
to study the enemy's capabilities in
real world situations.


---[1-L-3]---------------------------------
[2 hours] ago 12,423 small
recreational vessels appeared inside
[CE-10-2165-d's] orbital perimeter.
Hidden within that vast swarm were
seven massive freight carries. The
smaller craft were employed as
[ablative armor], allowing the
carries to descend through the
atmosphere; landing on top of major
population centers.

Despite the fact that the naval
garrison was aware of the likelihood
of just such an attack, their
ability to effectively defend
against it proved insufficient.


---[1-L-4]---------------------------------
This has always been the enemy's
[modus operandi]: [flood] your
opponent's ability to process
information with so much noise that
no meaningful resistance can be put
into action.

[3 minutes] ago those same population
centers began disappearing under
brilliant flashes. This was not an
ill conceived, poorly implemented
counter attack; it was a deliberate
denial of resources - those
resources being the remainder of
[CE-10-2165-d's] population.


---[1-L-5]---------------------------------
Is this the noble sacrifice my
creators spoke of? Where is the
nobility in these streets paved with
greasy carbon and dun ash? [My mouth
is speaking at another's behest] -
that is not my voice; that is the
other.

Its voice stands out as the single
calm note in the panicked cacophony
outside the sphere. It alone is not
decrying its fate or raging against
the [central government].

This anomaly bears closer
examination.

---[2-1]---------------------------------
Re: Enemy naval tactics:
When engaged, the enemy commits
every non-supraluminal craft with no
appreciable pattern or strategy
beyond making physical contact.
Conversely, all supraluminal craft
leave on seemingly random
trajectories.
I understand the goal of this
mission but time - our least
abundant resource - is wasted every
time we do a system-wide scan for
survivors. The time for saving lives
has passed. We must accept this if
we hope to win the war.


---[2-2]---------------------------------
Re: Enemy ground tactics:

All evidence suggests that use of
overwhelming force is the very
foundation of the enemy's combat
doctrine. And I adamantly refuse to
deploy personnel where the enemy has
available forces numbering in the
billions. With the very real
likelihood we are rapidly becoming
the last living specimens of our
race, all personnel are henceforth
confined to stasis until further
notice. Even with everyone equipped
with [C_12_CS[?]] we would have had
very little chance of survival, let
alone victory.


---[2-3]---------------------------------
Re: Enemy command structure:
We have intercepted several
transmissions from compound
intelligences whose proximity to the
core worlds mark them as key
targets. At present we are
disassembling these new
transmissions. Once we have more
[concrete conclusions] I will
forward them in their entirety.
Suffice it to say, that their
contents - the patterns they suggest
- are highly disturbing.


---[2-4]---------------------------------
Recommendations:
Iis my opinion that any system
where there is evidence that the
enemy has established a physical
presence is lost and must be razed.
This fleet currently retains the
capacity to force premature stellar
collapse; I advise that this be
established as standard operating
procedure for all compromised
systems forthwith. We cannot fight
this war by half measures if we
intend to win.

// FRAGMENT 2/7 [RECORDED VERBATIM
AND INTERPRETED POST-CATACLYSM]

L: I'm close to finishing the task.
The indexing and the archival
processes are as complete as I can
hope for. If we wait longer, we risk
catastrophe. The thing has already
destroyed every colony on my side of
the line.

Please. Activate the Array.


---[2-N-2]---------------------------------
D: No. Activation is murder.
A genocide larger than [this galaxy]
has ever known. We are sworn to
protect life not destroy it! That is
the Mantle we were given to carry.


---[2-N-3]---------------------------------
L: The Mantle. You still hold to
that  [fairy tale] after all that
has happened? After this thing has
consumed a million worlds?

Can't you see? Belief in the Mantle
sealed our doom! Weakened our
[protectorates], bred dependence and
sloth. Our [so-called Guardianship]
has stripped those we would keep
safe of any capacity for
self-defense!

Were we such noble [Guardians] when
we drew our line and abandoned
billions to the parasite?


---[2-N-4]---------------------------------
D: The Mantle has not failed!
I've already razed scores of worlds
- sterilized systems, routed and
[disintegrated] the parasite! We're
learning its tricks and strategies.
We can halt this thing! And we can
follow in Their footsteps!

There are no unstoppable forces in
this universe. There are no
immovable objects. Everything gives
if you push hard enough.


---[2-N-5]---------------------------------
L: And what about us, Didact?
We've been irresistible and
immovable for too long.
Maybe it's our turn to give.

 // FRAGMENT 3/7 [RECORDED VERBATIM
 AND INTERPRETED POST-CATACLYSM]

D: We have the answer. We've built
Mendicant Bias. It's a contender
class [AI], unlike anything we've
ever achieved.

And we've observed a pattern it
can exploit.


---[3-N-6]---------------------------------
The parasite has formed a Compound
Mind. When it reaches a certain
mass, the Mind is able to recoil its
disparate parts to create a
[tactical shield]. This is a simple
matter of mass preservation. The
thing has no compunction about
sacrificing parts of the whole. But
when the core of the Mind is
threatened, it reacts violently
and quickly.

This is the only time we ever see
the thing retreat or slow its growth.


---[3-N-7]---------------------------------
If we are to defeat it, the trick
will be coordinating our forays
against the [sprawling infection]
while Mendicant Bias assaults the
Mind's core. So far, we've been
hesitant to use certain weapons
because of the damage they cause
surviving populations and
environments.

That protocol has now been abandoned.


---[3-N-8]---------------------------------
Mendicant will draw the Mind into
battle outside the line, dealing
with local biomass and other parts
as best he can. The scale of the
problem is vast, but the strategy
is sound. It will require patience,
materiel and an investment of energy
unlike anything we have ever
considered.

It's a dangerous plan that carries
more risk than the Array, but I
believe it can work. Even if we
simply force it to retreat - to
retract - that will at least give us
some respite. Some time to muster
more resources...

Some time to rescue you.


---[3-N-10]---------------------------------
L: Are you insane? Would you risk
every life in the galaxy for this
transparently futile plan? Have you
learned nothing in these last

laugh at your efforts!

Do not let your concern for my
welfare commit you to this suicidal
scheme!

REPORT: SECURITY BREACH: 1/3
Heuristic pathology; [alpha site]
experienced an impermanent
containment failure event on
[spurious-data/no_ref.[?]]. The
suspect data barrier interchange
anomaly was detected precisely
[.489 seconds] after its appearance.
The epicenter of the disturbance is
the partition currently housing a
[personality construct array]
retrieved from Contender AI 05-032
<+> 0816.


---[3-L-2]---------------------------------
REPORT: SECURITY BREACH: 2/3
Although [adjacent] systems reacted
to the disturbance within expected
parameters, a more comprehensive
investigation was undertaken.
A physical search revealed that
there was no [corporeal] tampering
at the [alpha site].


Interchange manipulation comparisons
showed that all subunits are still
active, if at slightly lower rates.
Total containment failure elapsed
time was [3.13 seconds].


---[3-L-3]---------------------------------
REPORT: SECURITY BREACH: 3/3
In the [42 minutes, 9 seconds] since
the original anomaly was discovered
two more anomalies were detected in
unrelated systems.

The portal management/life support
control system within the boundary
complex was momentarily disabled
before the cause was [bottled] and
disassembled. A diagnostic sweep of
the central archives was initiated
and subsequently halted. The origin
of the request cannot be traced.

AND INTERPRETED POST-CATACLYSM]

L: Something is wrong! It's moving
away! At night I can see it -
flitting shadows - black against the
stars. Thousands of ships!
Not spiraling outward, but heading
for the line! This is the tipping
point, Didact. It's no longer
feeding.

It's coming for you.


---[4-N-2]---------------------------------
L: I've remotely destroyed our
Keyships. A security measure.
Without them I cannot reach the Ark.
But neither then can the thing.

I'm trapped. On a beautiful, empty
world. Its inhabitants have been
safely indexed, every single one
of them. They're special - well
worth the effort it took to build
one final gateway, even at this late
hour.


---[4-N-3]---------------------------------
This may be our last communication.
I'm begging you. Fire the Array.
Light the weapon, and let it be done.


---[4-N-4]---------------------------------
D: We've confirmed your
observations. Infected supraluminal
ships are arrowing inward from
several clusters. No more spiral
growth. The thing is
counterattacking. Suppression,
Security and Emergency Circumstance
fleets are all being recalled.
Systems are evacuating.

Mendicant Bias is no longer
communicating with us.

But now I can guess where you are.

Considering the enemy compound
intelligence's raw [computing] power
the Key-ships strategy will only
remain viable for another [657,000
hours] and this current stalemate
has the potential to last
considerably longer than that.

With my understanding of the enemy's
[modus operandi], its logical
boundaries, and [catalog of witness]
I have devised what I believe is our
most sound fall-back strategy.


---[5-2]---------------------------------
By [cutting fire breaks[?]] into the
[core worlds' volume] we would be
able to frustrate the enemy's
advances for approximately [70,080
hours] and lure them into costly
naval battles.

While the its resources on the
ground are effectively limitless, it
has a finite number of vessels to
spread from system to system.
Fortunately the majority of them are
unarmed and unarmored, private and
commercial craft.


---[5-3]---------------------------------
If we start immediately - commence
total biosphere elimination of life
sustaining worlds (as indicated in
the accompanying charts) and
relocate evacuated populations to
facilities such as those described
in the [Onyx project] - all this
could be achieved in [57,1590 (+-
2,184) hours].

chronicle of overindulgence and
self-appointed authority. You have
spent millennia [navel-gazing]
while the universe has continued to
evolve. And now you claim the Mantle
is justification for impending
nature's inevitable refinement?

You are deluded. But through death
you will transcend ignorance.

---[6-1]---------------------------------
Follow-up report from the Primary
Pioneer Group (hereafter: PPG) is
[173 hours] delinquent.

Report [G617a~k/g/post_landfall]
seemed most promising: a planet
capable of supporting life located
within the near border region of the
[galactic halo] with no indigenous
sentient species.


---[6-2]---------------------------------
The section indicating no fauna of
any kind shall be considered
anomalous until verified by Advance
Survey Team - Alpha (hereafter:
AST-A) team leader [##_#[?]].
If confirmed, that fact alone would
justify the dispatch of an
investigative group to [G 617 g].


---[6-3]---------------------------------
If neither the PPG nor the AST-A
have delivered a follow-up report
within the next [333 hours] this
office will have no recourse but to
send a medium intensity military
exploratory detachment to determine
the exact nature of the previously
mentioned delinquency.

ROGUE PROCESS ghost.713> [REDIRECTION]

---[6-N-1]---------------------------------
// BEGIN FRAGMENT 6/7 [RECORDED
VERBATIM AND INTERPRETED
POST-CATACLYSM]

L: My work is done. The portal is
inactive, and I've begun the burial
measures. Soon there'll be nothing
but sand and rock and normal ferrite
signatures.

You should see the mountain that
watches over it. A beautiful thing -
a snowcapped sentinel. That's where
I will spend what time is left to me.


---[6-N-2]---------------------------------
Did I tell you? I built a garden.
The earth is so rich. A seed falls
and a tree sprouts or a flower
blooms. There's so much... potential.
We knew this was a special place
because of them, but unless you've
been here, you can't know.

It's [Eden].


---[6-N-3]---------------------------------
I have to stop transmitting. The
thing is listening. Its [thinking
dead] are babbling - laughing
through every channel they can find.

Be proud. The Mind claims victory,
yet it still doesn't suspect. You've
outwitted it, my love. And now you
can destroy it.

But you cannot save me.

// FRAGMENT ENDS


---[6-L-1]---------------------------------
[12:H 20:M 00:S]
I begin this report with no
illusions that it will ever be seen
by its intended readers. In all
likelihood they have already
committed [species-wide suicide]
with the goal of preserving
biological diversity in this galaxy.
I must ensure that this information
reaches those who must come after.
If I fail in this, how can they not
regard my creators' sacrifice as
anything but [a crime without
measure]?


---[6-L-2]---------------------------------
[12:H 19:M 59:S]
Contender AI 05-032<//>Mendicant
Bias is returning and has the
capacity to bring the enemy through
the [Maginot] sphere. The crews of
my task force are aware of the
opposing fleet's size; all data
indicates that they have prepared
themselves - but with biologicals
anything is possible. I will make
sure that [malfunctioning equipment]
does no further damage. Perhaps its
current failure will finally allow
it to succeed at the task it was
originally created for.


---[6-L-3]---------------------------------
[11:H 15:M 48:S]
Mendicant has burrowed through the
sphere exactly where I expected -
a direct path from initial rampancy
to final retribution. Rage has made
it predictable. If the fate of the
crews of my auxiliary fleet were not
already a foregone conclusion I
would rate their chance of survival
at [1:1,960,000].

Even though 05-032's declaration of
hostilities simplified strategic
preparations; I do not expect an
easy fight - just one I cannot lose.


---[6-L-4]---------------------------------
[11:H 12:M 09:S]
05-032 was right about one thing:
there is only one way to defeat the
enemy, and that is to visit utter
annihilation on it.

If the galaxy must be [rendered
temporarily lifeless], so be it.

As Mendicant stated in its report
[58,078:H 48:M 12:S ago]: half
measures will not suffice.


---[6-L-5]---------------------------------
[09:H 45:M 18:S]
In support of 05-032's original 1000
core vessels is a fleet numbering
4,802,019; though only 1.8 percent
are warships - and only 2.4 percent
of that number are capital ships -
I am outnumbered [436.6:1]. I expect
my losses will be near total, but
overwhelming force has its own
peculiar drawbacks.

Such a press of arms invites many
opportunities for unintentional
fratricide.


---[6-L-6]---------------------------------
[07:H 36:M 41:S]
My auxiliaries are momentarily
stunned by Mendicant's opening
move - 1,784,305 leisure craft
ranging from [45 ~ 5769 tonnes]
advance in hopes of overwhelming my
comparatively tiny force. I do not
have enough [weapon systems] to
target them all.

It is a mathematical certainty that
some of them will get through and
attempt to board. There isn't a
single warship with this first wave.
It seems my opponent's rage has left
no room for respect.


---[6-L-7]---------------------------------
[04:H 01:M 55:S]
I could have countered its move if I
had released my fighters. They are
ready but idle; making their base
vessels more attractive prizes than
targets. Now the first of many waves
of commercial vessels mixed with
single ships and assault craft surge
forward. The first ship from my
fleet to be boarded breaks formation
and races into the oncoming
vessels - striking one amidships.
The cargo vessel's hull splits open
and out of it explodes not the
expected consumer goods but 31,860
dying warriors.


---[6-L-8]---------------------------------
[00:H 19:M 02:S]
The seventh and final wave of
container ships, barges, tankers, and
military vessels engage my fleet;
another 214,320 ships, many in
excess of [50,000 tonnes], engage my
seemingly disrupted vanguard. I
continue to fight just well enough
to seem lucky.

Mendicant, or the enemy, has been
sending a small percentage of its
fleet elsewhere. Good. Let them
believe they can seize a foothold
somewhere inside the sphere.


---[6-L-9]---------------------------------
[00:H 00:M 11:S]
Despite all its faults, 05-032 has
fought remarkably well.

My auxiliaries lay in tatters - more
than half of them are now part of
the enemy fleet. But just as I had
predicted, 05-032 concentrated on
them like they were the sole key to
victory. Its desire to punish our
creators blinded it to the true
purpose of my [feints]. I have
reduced the combat effectiveness of
its core fleet to 79.96 percent.
Surely now it must realize that
something is amiss.


---[6-L-10]---------------------------------
[00:H 00:M 00:S]
The [Halo effect] strikes our
combined fleets. All ships piloted
by biologicals are now [adrift].

I can trade Mendicant ship for ship
now and still prevail.


---[6-L-11]---------------------------------
[00:H 00:M 01:S]
Of my ships that had been captured,
11.3 percent of them are close
enough to Mendicant's core fleet
that they can be used offensively -
either by initiating their
self-destruct sequences, or by
opening unrestricted ruptures into
[slipstream space].

It is best that our crews perished
now; because the battle that is
about to ensue would have driven
them mad.


---[6-L-12]---------------------------------
[00:H 00:M 02:S]
I throw away all the rules of
acceptable conduct during battle;
near the ruptures I throw away all
the accepted ideas of how the
natural world is supposed to behave.
I toss around [37,654 tonne]
dreadnaughts like they were
fighters; dimly aware of the former
crews being crushed to liquescence.

For now all my concentration is
focused on inertial control and
navigation. Targeting isn't even a
consideration - I will be engaging
my enemy at arm's length.


---[6-L-13]---------------------------------
[00:H 01:M 14:S]
05-032 abandoned the tactic of using
derelict ships as cover after [72:S]
- It seems that 52 core vessels lost
to the ruptured fuel cells of
derelict ships was lesson enough.
Add another 608 lost to collision,
point fire, structural failure due
to inertial manipulation, and
[slipstream space] induced
discoherence and I now outnumber
Mendicant [6:1].


---[6-L-14]---------------------------------
[00:H 03:M 00:S]
Mendicant was able to postpone its
inevitable annihilation for [106:S]
with its attempt to flee. But the
last of its core vessels hangs
before me now; crippled and defeated
but still sensate. I could spare it;
carve out what is left of its
[personality construct array] and
deliver it to [Installation Zero]
for study.

I doubt it would have extended the
same courtesy to me.

---[7-1]---------------------------------
[Father].

I hope this message finds you well
and helps you understand my
decision. Today I leave the only
world I have ever called home, not
for glory or [the anomalous desire
to end another's life[?]] as you
have [indicted]; but to [travel the
path of demons[?]] to spare the
hands of [another Father's son].


---[7-2]---------------------------------
'Had we acted sooner; had we acted
more decisively...'

Living in the past is a luxury none
of us can afford. We must learn from
it, but we cannot live there. It is
impossible to plan for the [now] -
the present is ever fleeting. [The
future] is where we must live - [the
future] is what we must plan for.


---[7-3]---------------------------------
I do not look to trade my life in
order to preserve our past, but to
secure the future - and if not ours,
then the future of some [culture]
yet to come.

Isn't sacrifice in the interest of
others what you spoke of as being so
noble? Should I have allowed another
to bloody his hands while I remained
safe behind a [shield of privilege]?

You raised me better than that.

[Filial Devotion]

I AM MENDICANT BIAS.
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DONE.

 ---[7-N-1]---------------------------------
// FRAGMENT 7/7 [RECORDED VERBATIM
AND INTERPRETED POST-CATACLYSM]

D: Proud? When I have failed you
utterly, how can I feel anything
but sorrow?

Bias has come undone. He crossed
the line this morning - brought the
abomination with him - and destroyed
your waiting rescue party.

It's over. We're activating the
[destructive arrayed matrix],
our shameful last resort.


---[7-N-2]---------------------------------
I can picture you in your garden,
surveying all you have created -
surveying all you have preserved.
And I curse the circumstance that
keeps my finger on the trigger.

D: Of all the fates to befall us,
this is the cruelest of all.
My inaction and hesitation and
foolishness kept me here, on the
wrong side of the Line. And [300
years [?]] of our society's failure
and miscalculation makes me your
executioner.


---[7-N-3]---------------------------------
It's too much to bear.

// ERROR - NO CARRIER OR RECEIPT AVAILABLE {DEAD END TRANSMISSION}
//INFORMATION DESTROYED IN TRANSIT


---[7-N-4]---------------------------------
D. Mendicant Bias is trying to
prevent us from firing the Array.
He speeds back to the Ark, but he
won't succeed. Offensive Bias will
stop him, and I will burn this
stinking menace in your name.

And then?

I will begin our Great Journey
without you, carrying this bitter
record. Those who come after will
know what we bought with this [false
transcendence] - what you bought,
and the price you paid.

---[7-L-1]---------------------------------
You don't know the contortions I had
to go through to follow you here,
Reclaimer. I know what you're here
for. What positions do I take? Will I
follow one betrayal with another?


---[7-L-2]---------------------------------
You're going to say I'm making a
habit of turning on my masters.

But the one that destroyed me long
ago, in the upper atmosphere of a
world far distant from here, was an
implement far cruder than I.
My weakness was my capacity -
unintentional though it was! - to
choose the Flood. A mistake my
makers would not soon forgive.

But I want something far different
from you, Reclaimer.

Atonement.


---[7-L-3]---------------------------------
And so here at the end of my life,
I do once again betray a former
master. The path ahead is fraught
with peril. But I will do all I can
to keep it stable - keep you safe.
I'm not so foolish to think this
will absolve me of my sins. One life
hardly balances billions.

But I would have my masters know
that I have changed.

And you shall be my example.
